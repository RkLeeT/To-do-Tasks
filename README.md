# To-do-Tasks

Plain Javascript 

1. The application user will see a list of tasks that he has to complete

2. Every task will have two states: “Pending”, “Completed”, which can be shown using color codes (green for completed; blue for pending)

3. By default, every task will be in “Pending” state

4. On swiping right on a pending task item, that item moves to the completed state

5. On swiping left on a completed task item, that item moves to the pending state

6. States of the tasks is persisted, i.e., if we close the application and reopen it, the tasks which are completed and pending remains as it is; 
which is done by using localStorage.
